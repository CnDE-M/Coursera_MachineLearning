# Cousera_MarchineLearning

This is a notebook of online course Machine Learning made by Andrew Ng.
Contents are divided by "week", with a key idea noted behind in the file name.

+ Week_1:
Optimize Î¸s for linear regression model: [1] Gradient Descent; [2] Normal Equation;
+ Week_2:
Regularization methods for **Gradient Descent** and **Normal Equation**;
+ Week_3:
Classification model
+ Week_4:
Neural Network


In each file, there are:
+ LectureNote.md: notes on this week's class; 
+ Script_intro.md: how method realised in scripts, with practical example and result comparision with built-in function in MATLAB
+ Method.m: codes to realize.
